# Pok√©mon Arena! Website

All of the relevant information about our project is located in the [Wiki](https://github.com/cireficc/pokemon-arena-website/wiki) for this repository. We chose to use Github's Wiki feature as a simple means of creating and editing pages, as opposed to forking and submitting pull requests for individual files, which was too much complexity for such a simple thing.
